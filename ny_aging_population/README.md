# NYC Aging Population

Interactive data visualitation of elderly people in NYC (65+ years) by blocks and census tracts.

Maps by blocks:

1. Gradient map: areas plotted by percentage of population from ligther to darker colors (Notebook v1).
2. Threshold map: areas plotted only when criteria is met (e.g., mean, median...) (Notebook v2).

Maps by census tracts:

1. Similar to blocks threshold map + GeoJSON parsing.

Technologies: Python, Folium, JSON, GeoJSON, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook.

Original idea and design by Barbara Alonso (@).
